Title: Data Manipulation Assignment Instructions

author: Harun Celik

For this assignment, you will work in pairs to answer the questions
asked within the `dplyr-tidyr-asignment.qmd` file. You may choose to
work on each question together or select the subjects that you think you
may be more interested in practicing. At the end of the activity, I will
hand out a key that can provide ways to reach the answers.

If you are working on separate files, please name your own files as
`FirstName.qmd`, with your first name (i.e, `Harun.qmd`).
